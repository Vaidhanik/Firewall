Location: Deployed on a web server, accessible via browser

Key Features:
- User-friendly interface for managing firewall policies
- Displays network activity logs and analytics
- Shows alerts and anomalies detected by the AI/ML system

- Allows configuration of system-wide settings

Modules:
1. User Interface: React-based frontend for user interactions
2. Authentication Module: Handles user login and access control
3. Policy Management Interface: Allows creation and modification of firewall policies
4. Log Viewer: Displays logs and allows searching/filtering
5. Dashboard: Shows system overview, alerts, and key metrics
6. Configuration Interface: Allows adjustment of system settings
7. API Client: Communicates with the Central Management Server API

### 2.4 AI/ML-based Anomaly Detection System (Python)

Location: Deployed alongside the Central Management Server

Key Features:
- Processes network usage logs
- Detects anomalies in network behavior using machine learning algorithms
- Generates alerts for abnormal behavior
- Continuously improves detection accuracy through model updates

Modules:
1. Data Preprocessor: Cleans and formats log data for analysis
2. Feature Extractor: Extracts relevant features from the log data
3. Anomaly Detector: Implements machine learning models for anomaly detection
4. Alert Generator: Creates alerts based on detected anomalies
5. Model Trainer: Periodically retrains models to improve accuracy
6. Performance Evaluator: Monitors and reports on model performance

### 2.5 Database (PostgreSQL)

Location: Deployed on a dedicated database server or cloud database service

Key Features:
- Stores firewall policies
- Stores network activity logs
- Stores system configuration
- Stores user information for the Web Console
- Stores anomaly detection results and alerts

Tables:
1. Policies: Stores firewall rules and policies
2. Logs: Stores network activity logs
3. Agents: Stores information about registered firewall agents
4. Users: Stores Web Console user information
5. Alerts: Stores generated alerts and anomalies
6. Config: Stores system-wide configuration

### 2.6 Message Queue (RabbitMQ)

Location: Deployed alongside the Central Management Server

Key Features:
- Facilitates asynchronous communication between components
- Ensures reliable delivery of messages
- Allows for scalable processing of logs and alerts

Queues:
1. LogQueue: For sending logs from agents to the Central Management Server
2. PolicyUpdateQueue: For distributing policy updates to agents
3. AlertQueue: For sending alerts from the Anomaly Detection System to the Central Management Server

## 3. Data Flow

1. Application Network Access:
   - Application on endpoint attempts to access the network
   - Firewall Agent intercepts the traffic
   - Agent analyzes the traffic and applies relevant policies
   - Agent logs the activity
   - Traffic is allowed or blocked based on policy

2. Log Processing:
   - Agent sends logs to the Central Management Server via Message Queue
   - Central Management Server processes and stores logs in the Database
   - AI/ML system analyzes logs for anomalies

3. Policy Update:
   - Admin creates/updates policy via Web Console
   - Web Console sends policy update to Central Management Server
   - Central Management Server stores policy in Database
   - Central Management Server distributes policy to relevant Agents via Message Queue

4. Anomaly Detection:
   - AI/ML system detects an anomaly
   - Anomaly details sent to Central Management Server via Message Queue
   - Central Management Server stores alert in Database
   - Web Console displays alert to admin

5. Agent Update:
   - New agent version is uploaded via Web Console
   - Central Management Server distributes update to Agents
   - Agents perform self-update

## 4. Security Considerations

1. Encryption: All communication between components uses TLS 1.3
2. Authentication: 
   - Agents use certificate-based authentication with the Central Management Server
   - Web Console users authenticate using OAuth 2.0
3. Authorization: Role-based access control for Web Console users
4. Integrity: All agent updates are signed and verified before installation
5. Audit Logging: All administrative actions are logged for auditing purposes

## 5. Scalability and Performance

1. Load Balancing: Central Management Server and Web Console are deployed behind load balancers
2. Database Scaling: 
   - Read replicas for improved read performance
   - Partitioning of log data by date for efficient querying
3. Message Queue Scaling: 
   - Multiple queue workers for processing logs and distributing updates
4. Caching: Redis cache for frequently accessed data (e.g., active policies)

## 6. Monitoring and Maintenance

1. Health Checks: Regular health checks for all system components
2. Metrics Collection: Detailed metrics collected for system performance and usage
3. Alerting: Automated alerts for system issues or anomalies
4. Backup and Recovery: Regular backups of database and configuration data
5. Disaster Recovery Plan: Documented procedures for system recovery in case of failure

## 7. Compliance and Regulations

1. Data Protection: Compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant data protection regulations
2. Audit Trail: Comprehensive logging of all system activities for compliance audits
3. Data Retention: Configurable data retention policies in line with legal requirements

## 8. Future Enhancements

1. Integration with external threat intelligence feeds
2. Support for additional endpoint operating systems (e.g., macOS)
3. Implementation of a machine learning model for automatic policy generation
4. Development of mobile app for monitoring and basic management

This High Level Design provides a comprehensive overview of the application firewall system architecture. It covers the main components, their interactions, key features, and important considerations for security, scalability, and compliance. As the project progresses, this design can be further refined and expanded to include more specific implementation details.
